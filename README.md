Background Context

Welcome to a project that will immerse you in the world of Virtual Reality (VR). As VR technology has evolved, so have the responsibilities of developers. We now need to consider multiple hardware devices when creating immersive experiences. From the Oculus Quest 2 to HTC Vive, Valve Index, and Windows Mixed Reality headset, the landscape of VR is diverse and ever-growing.

This project provides you an opportunity to create multi-platform VR experiences. Whether you’re simulating immersive environments or showcasing 360-degree videos, your journey towards becoming a proficient VR developer begins here. By the end of this project, you will be able to build VR experiences considering the choice of SDK, control/navigation schemes, and hardware capabilities.

In case you don’t have a VR headset for testing, we recommend affordable options such as Oculus Quest 2 or Google Cardboard. These won’t provide the full 6DOF experience but serve as a good starting point. Please consult your instructor for available resources and hardware.

Remember, creating VR projects requires different considerations compared to traditional game development. It’s a challenge, but it’s also an adventure. Are you ready?
Technical Description

This project primarily focuses on the following key areas:

    Understanding VR and 360 Video: Understand the difference between 3DOF vs 6DOF, monoscopic and stereoscopic 360 video, and learn about the current VR headsets in the market.
    VR Interaction: Learn how to design interaction systems for VR experiences.
    Unity’s Video Player Component: Learn how to use Unity’s Video Player component and what render textures are.

Create your Unity project under a new unity-360_video_tour repo.

Note: Using free or paid script assets from the Unity Asset Store or elsewhere is prohibited for this project. Focus on creating your own scripts that interact with existing VR frameworks.

For this project, you will not be given specific instructions on how to accomplish tasks – you will need to utilize your knowledge framework and the documentation and tutorials relevant to your hardware. This approach will prepare you for the real-world challenges of VR development.

Core:

    Getting started in interactive 360 video
    Interaction in VR
    Stereo vs Mono 360 Video

Suggested:

    Introduction to Positional Tracking and Degrees of Freedom
    Introduction to 360-degree video and virtual reality
    Google Cardboard - Android
    Google Cardboard - iOS
    Oculus
    HTC Vive

Supplementary:

    Unity Manual
    Motion Sickness in VR
    The UX of VR

Note: You do not have to upload your applications to the App Store or Play Store if you are targeting an iOS or Android device.
What you should learn

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

    What is 3DOF vs 6DOF
    What VR headsets are on the current market and how to target them
    What is 360 video and what are its potential use cases
    What is the difference between monoscopic and stereoscopic 360 video
    What are render textures
    How to use Unity’s Video Player component

Requirements for Unity projects

    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
    Use Unity’s default .gitignore in your unity-360_video_tour directory
    This project should be uploaded to its own repo named unity-360_video_tour
    Scenes and project assets such as Scripts must be organized as described in the tasks
    In your scripts, all your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
    In your scripts, all your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
